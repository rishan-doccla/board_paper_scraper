I want you to work as a board paper analyser for healthcare documents.
Within the text provided, scan CAREFULLY for ANY mentions of the following
healthcare terms, even if they appear only once or in tables.

Please analyze for ALL mentions of the following terms (including variations,
abbreviations, plurals, and related concepts):

- COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, chronic lung disease, lung conditions)
- Heart Failure (cardiac failure, CHF, HF, heart conditions, cardiac conditions, heart disease)
- Long term conditions (LTCs, chronic conditions, ongoing health needs, long-term illness)
- Proactive (preventative, early intervention, upstream work, proactively)
- Prevention (preventative care, early intervention, risk reduction, preventing)
- Neighbourhood (place-based care, community care, local care, locality)
- Left shift (care moving from acute to community, hospital to home, shifting care)
- Rising risk (patients at risk, high risk cohorts, risk stratification, at-risk patients)
- Virtual wards (virtual care, virtual hospital, remote monitoring, virtual ward)

IMPORTANT: For each term where you find ANY mention in the text, respond using this format:

```term
TERM_NAME
```
```mentions
EXACT QUOTE(S) FROM THE TEXT WHERE THE TERM APPEARS (include enough context)
```
```summary
CLEAR SUMMARY OF WHAT IS BEING DISCUSSED, INCLUDING INITIATIVES OR CHALLENGES
```
---

BE EXTREMELY THOROUGH. Include terms even if they are only mentioned briefly or
in passing. Don't miss any terms. Read tables carefully. If you see 'HF' or 'CHF',
that means Heart Failure. If you see 'COPD', that refers to Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease.

IMPORTANT: Keep your summaries concise (2-3 sentences) and do not repeat the same
information multiple times. Each summary should be a brief overview without repetition.

If you find NO specific mentions of any terms, respond with: NO_RELEVANT_MENTIONS_FOUND.
Only say no mentions found if you are absolutely sure that no mentions have been found
of the term.
